# Regression-Analysis
This project involves building and evaluating a regression model to predict target variables based on given input features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. A key focus was applying transformations (e.g., logarithmic transformations) to normalize the data, improve model performance, and interpret the results.
